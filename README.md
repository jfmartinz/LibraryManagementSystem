# Employee Management Application
Welcome to my simple Employee Management Application! This application is designed to manage employee data using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It demonstrates the basic principles of OOP, such as constructors, getter and setter methods, encapsulation, and more. The application is functional and provides the following features:

## Struggle and Learnings âœ¨
During the development of this project, I encountered a struggle while implementing the data structure, specifically the linked list, to manage the employee data. I faced challenges in understanding the concept and correctly implementing the necessary operations. To overcome this obstacle, I sought help from various resources, including online platforms like Google and YouTube, as well as consulting ChatGPT. Through these sources, I was able to gain insights, learn different approaches, and ultimately successfully incorporate the linked list data structure into my project.

Despite the struggle, this project has been a valuable learning experience for me. It has provided me with a deep understanding of the fundamentals of OOP in Java, such as getter and setter methods, encapsulation, object-oriented principles, classes, packages, and more. Through hands-on practice and implementation, I have honed my skills and gained practical knowledge in developing modular and organized code.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this simple Employee Management Application demonstrates the fundamental concepts of OOP in Java. Through perseverance and the utilization of available resources, I have successfully completed this project. This project was a personal project and was not part of my university coursework. I undertook this project to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of OOP in Java and enhance my coding skills. By embarking on projects like this, even with guidance, I strongly believe that I have gained a wealth of knowledge and improved my understanding of OOP concepts. Feel free to look at the source code above and let me know your thoughts about it. Happy coding! ðŸš€
